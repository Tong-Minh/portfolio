How to compile and run your program
    --> DO NOT CLICK THE PLAY BUTTON WHEN USING YOUR FAVORITE EDITOR
    --> Download 'project4.zip' file and unzip it
    --> On the terminal, travel to that files directory
    --> Add the necessary files for grading (Cell, NGen, Stack1Gen, etc...)
    --> Type javac MyMaze.java to compile and then java MyMaze to run

Any assumptions
    --> the user includes the space, as directed, by the format part of the prompt

Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
    --> input is entered like in the chess project, project 2. ([num1] [num2])
    --> re-prompts input if wrong input is entered, like if the value isn't between 5 and 20 for either

Any known bugs or defects in the program
    --> the user has to input dimensions like (5 19), (6 12), etc... or else it would stop the program and throw a NumberFormatException
