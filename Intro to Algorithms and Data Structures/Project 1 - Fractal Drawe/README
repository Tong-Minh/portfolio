How to compile and run your program
- Type java FractalDrawer.java in the terminal, input a shape, input a number
- See the shape appear, see the area(rounded) printed
- Every time my program recursively calls its own method to draw more fractals, its drawing the main shape + the smaller fractals again, and so I count all that in my area calculation as well

Any assumptions
- I assume the person provides inputs within reason, such as a number greater than 0 for the level consignment and a listed shape
- I assume they have a display wide enough to be able to display the generated shapes and that they know to maximize the screen

Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
- User can input the levels as well as the shape
- Checks for valid inputs for both the levels and shapes
- Randomization of fractal colors

Any known bugs or defects in the program
- When checking for valid inputs for the levels for recursion, if the user inputs a string, it will throw an error up because the program doesn't account for the fact that the user might enter that
- Once the n or level or recursion for the fractals gets about 9ish, it can break the program, but the code is solid

Any outside sources (aside from course resources) consulted for ideas used in the project, in
the format:
- Using Java.util.random for randomization of coloring: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html
